            Yoga is an art, exercise, and way of life that increases flexibility, strength, and protects against
            injury. It promotes longevity as the exercises can balance ones metabolism, and improves the cardiovacular
            system. Yoga improves general vitality as it increases your energy, yet relaxes you and settles your mind.
            All levels welcome. Join us today!

      <h3 class="green">Yoga Studio Etiquette</h3>
      <p>
        The yoga studio is a special kind of gathering place. In the spirit of community, and respect for each other, remember yoga is
        a practice in awareness:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arrive ten to fifteen minutes before class begins. This gives you time to take off your shoes, store your belongings, and
          lay out your mat in the studio.
        </li>
        <li>
          While waiting for class to begin, it is customary to sit quietly or speak softly with your neighbor. Be mindful that other
          students may be relaxing or meditating.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take off your shoes before entering the studio. And do not bring food or any drink other than water into the studio. This
          helps us keep the studio clean.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid wearing perfume, essential oils, or products that have a fragrance. Some people are sensitive to these scents. Please
          keep your yoga mat clean and odor free.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place your mat in alignment with the length of the room, and be willing to adjust location to make room for others if the
          room fills up. And, never walk on another person’s mat.
        </li>
        <li>
          If class has started, be mindful not to cause an interruption, especially if the class is in meditation. Sometimes, late
          arrivals cannot be accommodated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tell your teacher about any injuries or special health conditions before class so that the teacher can make suggestions
          for adjustments, or poses to avoid.
        </li>
        <li>It’s best to bring your own yoga mat to class. This is especially important during cold and flu season.</li>
        <li>
          Leave cell phones outside the yoga studio. If you are on call or in an emergency situation, please let the teacher know
          so that we can accommodate you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Through self-awareness, consideration of others, and respect for the studio space, we can create a special environment to enjoy
        and grow our yoga practice.

        <h3>Hatha Yoga - Come Home To Your Body</h3>
        <p>
          What most of us know as yoga is the practice of physical postures, or "asanas", that comprise one aspect of the philosophical
          system of yoga. These postures are designed to purify and open the many channels of our body, especially the spine, so that energy
          may flow freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word hatha is also translated as “ha”, meaning sun and “tha”, meaning moon. This refers to the masculine and feminine aspects
          that reside in all of us. By balancing these aspects, we can develop strength and flexibility. Hatha yoga is a mindfulness practice.
          By practicing with awareness, without striving, without forcing, and accepting where we are in each moment, we can open to the innate
          healing wisdom of our body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The joy of hatha yoga is the journey, and the self-discovery within that journey. Deepen your yoga practice with steadiness and
          ease as you explore the relationship of your breath to your body. Breath is how we mobilize the spaces in our body. Posture is how
          we stabilize our bodies in space.
        </p>
        <p>The practice of yoga is experiential, that is what is appropriate for each individual body. It awakens us to the present.</p>
        <p>We practice yoga, not as an athletic endeavor, but as a way to come home to our bodies.</p>
